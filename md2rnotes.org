*** the error was not in actually installing the packages but finding a set of packages that are compatible with each other to install!

- it makes sense now -- the packages could not be installed because the dependencies were out of sync (in terms of compatibility?)
- after updating the dependencies, which showed that php-token-stream is being updated (in line with the compatibility issues before when tried to install the packages), it was showed that there was no packages to be installed (before I had already installed them previously)

- the second conjecture seems unlikely as changing the font-size to 28px was only done in resume.css

- wondering where the final css comes from?
** investigating how the command to generate the cv works
*** looks like the css is first stored in index.html before pre-pending it to the html generated of the cv
see: [[file:src/Resume/Command/HtmlCommand.php::$templateIndexPath%20=%20join(DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR,%20array($templatePath,%20'index.html'));]]
*** generating the pdf involves generating the html file first using the generateHtml() function in HtmlCommand.php
see: [[file:src/Resume/Command/PdfCommand.php::$rendered%20=%20$this->generateHtml($source,%20$template,%20false);]]
*** I suspect that the sequence at which the css files are concatenated are determined by the usort() function here

- Adila is right -- css file concatenation sequence is probably by alphabetical order

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
What the script does is replace {{{style}}} with the concatenated css files in the css folder. I think it does this in alphabetical order (element.less --> normalize.css --> pdf.css --> resume.css --> screen.css) so if you want to try and hack your way around this, you could also add a zzz.css file in your css/ folder. Since zzz.css will get concatenated last, it should overwrite everything that comes before it. -- Adila

- sparse checkout seems like a local thing and a filter
- it doesn't make any changes in the repository, which therefore cannot be propagated to remote
- I should try the final way I can think of: add submodule then remove all the unwanted stuff -- that way all the changes could be detected and propagate by git

** another solution would be to do it manually after finish writing my PDF -- wait that wouldn't work as well because it would disrupt the block that spans two pages
** trying to encase the whole footer in a div with a class
#+BEGIN_SRC 
@media screen {
    div.Footer {
        display: none;
    }
}

@media print {

** you can use <div> </div> and even use a class with them, but if it's not markdown="1", then markdown syntax within it wouldn't be rendered :mdtip:
For example, ~--------~ was supposed to be rendered as ~<hr></hr>~ but it was instead printed literally
*** using both tag works!
For example, ~<div markdown="1" class="Footer"> </div>~
** position: fixed; bottom: 0; does actually work when you print it directly from a browser!
- But the document is in a mess when directly printed from a browser!
** however, since Markdown resume generator is using wkhtmltopdf, which uses a Qt Webkit rendering engine, this doesn't work as well, as suggested by a comment on the stackoverflow page
** [master 282c0e0] removed all the footer stuff I was experimenting with before
** know when to use em as a measure of size because I might want to scale the font-size up and down. I guess it makes sense for top and bottom margin/padding/border -- as the font size increases, the line spacing should also increase, but for left and right it will not :csstip:
** don't even bother about the footer when it comes to the PDF... that means ~display:none~
** [master 21765a2] hide the footer since it won't appear on every single page and that information is already present in other parts of the document
** [master 957b7e1] changed h2 padding-bottom to .2em so that it scales with the font size
** many of the elements in html format are getting their widths from pdf.css. pdf.css is called before resume.css. pdf.css should contain the declarations that need to be changed in the pdf. However, declarations in pdf.css that are not in resume.css are also used in the html document! This is weird as I imagined pdf.css declaration to only come into effect when the output is pdf... maybe it is critical to think in terms of specificity values instead of sequence! :csstip:
** [master c5641cf] created a div class personalstatement and redefined p and h3 elements there!
** [master 7e9fea5] fixed widths in div.personalstatement in pdf.css
* 16oct10 Fixed margins and page number issues; decided to go for a more readable (read: bigger) version for the PDF since it will likely be printed on paper
** [master d28d699] use percentage for table left margin since don't want the left/right margin to be affect by text size -- relined the tables in the div up
** [master 0b18ef8] added some page-break stuff in dl but that doesn't seem to work for my purposes
*** leaving them there because they still make sense
** Guess will have to add manually page breaks when my document is complete!
here's an example: https://davidwalsh.name/css-page-breaks
** [master 7b684c1] added page-break-before to strengthen the case but nope, still doesn't work!
** [master 40afc1d] created a class that allows the manual addition of page breaks!
** [master a61430b] scaled font-size up
** margins can overlap but padding can't?
** [master 43a0b9c] fixed the spacing between h3 and h4 with padding -- margins didn't work so well as it overlapped with hr's margin
** [master b8d298d] fixed the alignment of h4 to h3 on pdf.css as well
** [master a0ac1d4] tweak the dl properties -- dt and dd font-size -- so that they look good on pdf
** you cannot control the margins on paper -- the margin and padding in pdf.css are for the html format too so they will only appear on the first and last page for top and bottom :csstip:
** [master 309d2c6] increased wkhtmltopdf's print top and bottom margins to 1.75cm! -- now all the margins (top/bottom/left/right) looks similar!
** command for page numbers that wouldn't work now because my wkhtmltopdf is not patched with qt
#+BEGIN_SRC 
// Process the document with wkhtmltopdf
exec('wkhtmltopdf -T 1.75cm -B 1.75cm --header-right ' . escapeshellarg('[page]'). ' ' . $pdfSource . ' ' . $destFilename);
#+END_SRC
** [master 8f10f5c] edited the wkhtmltopdf command so that (1) it uses one with patched Qt, (2) it sets the top and bottom margins to 1.75 cm, and (3) it prints a footer with page numbers
** [master b51fe33] edit footer-font-size to 10
** [master 595bf5f] increase the font-size to 11 so as a basis of comparison for the rest of the document -- the rest of the document should at least be size 11 as well
** [master c1e490e] changed h1 font-size to 300% (was 48px on resume.css, pdf.css and screen.css)
** note previous font-sizes
h1: 48px = 300%
h2: 18 px = 112.5%
ol li: 14 px = 87.5%
** [master 1ec6de7] set all font-sizes as percentages -- now they should scale properly!
** Generally, *1em = 12pt = 16px = 100%*. When using these font-sizes, let's see what happens when you increase the base font size (using the body CSS selector) from 100% to 120%. As you can see, both the em and percent units get larger as the base font-size increases, but pixels and points do not. :csstip:
** [master 1a03c57] fixed all the font-sizes exactly using the following conversion: 1em = 12pt = 16px = 100%
** I think it makes sense to set all the font-sizes to scale-able units and the padding/margin etc to em -- depending on what the font-size is
h3+ul dl dd: 73% = 8.76 pt
therefore, it needs to be scaled 11pt/8.76pt = 1.25570776256 = 126%
** seems like my calculations are wrong! the scaling is applied first
12 pt * 126% * 73% = 11.0376 
** tested it at 11 pt and it's indeed the same font-size as 73%; perhaps why they're not the same as the page number is because the page is actually shrunk to fit the paper by wkhtmltopdf!
** [master 834dbcb] made a new declaration for the #skills id such that instead of being placed side-by-side, they are stacked on top of each other. The new section allows #references to continue using the side-by-side layout
** [master 72b9a6c] scale font-size by 140% and fixed all the indentation problems that came with it -- the pdf version now looks very different from the html version
** [master 5d55826] fixed the unsightly reference section
** [master 92bffd6] prevent page break before and after horizontal rule
* 16oct16 Reverted PDF version back to 100% font-size and fixed all the alignment problems
** font-size/margin combinations that worked

Because not the whole width of the container is filled (h3 has its own padding etc), h3 width and content width doesn't add up to 100%.

| font-size | h3 width | h4 margin | content width | total width |
|-----------+----------+-----------+---------------+-------------|
|      140% |      16% |       29% |           71% |         87% |
|      100% |      12% |       23% |           77% |         89% |

** [master 9e2e129] changed container font-size back to 100% and table column width back to 45% 45% 10% so that everything aligns/fits
** [master 37f01e4] fixed alignment for tablet layout
** [master f9d7a40] fixed alignment for wide mobile layout
** these are basically the elements that I changed for tablet and wide mobile layout
Example for wide mobile layout:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
    h3+ul {
        width: 100%;
        
        li {
            width: 100%;
        }
    }

    dl {
        width: 100%;
    }

    h4 {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0.25em 0 0 0;
    }
    
    h4+ul {
        margin: 0.4em 0 0 0em;
    }
    
    table {
        margin: 0;
        width: 100%;
    }
    
    ol {
        margin: 0 0 0 0em;
        width: 86%;
    }

** [master b05b91d] fixed alignment for wide screen layout, and removed the corresponding properties from resume.css since they're overwritten anyway
** [master 07b9108] added some instructions to manipulate Firefox window size in the md2rwiki.org
** [master ff2cf84] fixed the ol width for tablet and wide mobile layout
** [master 9287530] fixed alignment for mobile layout
** you can remove the padding, margin and width properties from ~resume.css~ once they are defined in ~screen.css~
** [master aaa140e] fixed the issues that arose after margin and width properties were removed from resume.css
** [master 7e1c1f4] increased dl strong width to 20% (was unset) because its default width is causing it to be presented over two lines
** [master 0cc52a9] fixed space between the two cells (BS and PhD), line spacing of references dd, and h4+ul top margin
** [master 269f7f0] fixed h4 and h4+ul margin -- used to depend on text size, now percentage
Before:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
h4 {
    margin: 0em 0em 0em 8.8em;
    padding: 0.5em 0 0 0;
}

h4+ul {

* 16oct28 Use PDF icons for PDF links
** [master 8f4cfce] use pdf icons for pdf links
* 16nov20 Corrected the line spacing between unordered list items and after h4
** [master 2d84e73] set margins between list items of h4+ul to be 0.5 em or 8 px
** [master 959a351] added padding also to the bottom of h4 and added padding to both the top and bottom of h4 when processing the CV as a pdf
** [master 008a169] html h4-table spacing seems to work fine -- reduced the top margin of table in pdf form
* 16nov24 Major makeover for the PDF version, mostly to adapt it to bigger font sizes so people can actually read my CV when it's printed out!
** [master f0f95a1] enlarged all body text in PDF, and changed the 'skills' section so that it's vertical not horizontal, and added print out of links to the PDF
* 16nov25 Print out the website in the PDF version so that people know that they can also view my CV online
** [master 754923e] align blockquote to the right and print out website of CV in pdf
* 16nov28 Reduced font-size of my personal statement to 100% -- no reason to increase it from 12 pt (scaled up 130% by pdf.css)
** [master 8c1c898] reduced the font-size of personal statement to 100%
- scaled up 130% in pdf.css so not sure what's the final size
- just remember that the font-size of the page number is 11 pt

** Tried to fix page-break issues when printing with wkhtmltopdf
*** Two common causes
1. parent ~div~ is ~float~: https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/issues/1604
2. ~overflow: hidden~: https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/issues/1551#issuecomment-618993844
*** What I tried
- Tried remedying this by fixing those properties in e.g. ~body.pdf~, ~.container~ and ~.resume~ but to no avail.
- It's not a problem specific to the ~page-break~ command being unavoidable. Even if the opposite command is given (i.e. ~page-break-before: always;~, the command is ignored.
- also not entirely sure if it is the problem with ~wkhtmltopdf~ -- the command is also not respected when printing directly from the html, from a Chrome browser.
- although I must say that there are no weird page breaks when printing directly from the browser, and could be a permanent solution is I manage to fix the ugly font
